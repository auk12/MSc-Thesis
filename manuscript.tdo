\contentsline {todo}{cite intrapartum strategy and debate about how to invest: more emoc or skilled attendants at birth. need to better set up the importance of referral system in both.}{6}{section*.21}
\contentsline {todo}{i'd remove from ``by'' to end and introduce details later. specific details introduced here do not support referral piece, so it's not the best way to end this paragraph.}{6}{section*.22}
\contentsline {todo}{insert mobile money and cite mpesa specfically before moving into health. that's where most progress has been made, certainly most uptake.}{7}{section*.24}
\contentsline {todo}{not sure about ``most promising'' because we don't know compared to what. maybe just ``are a promising''.}{7}{section*.25}

\contentsline {todo}{i think you can expand this paragraph to synthesize the gaps, introduce baby monitor (all but technical details like verboice), and then articulate the motivation for this focus on referrals.}{8}{section*.35}
\contentsline {todo}{i'd make this last sentence a new paragraph and describe the kenyan system in a few sentences. alternatively, and maybe preferably, add this to the introduction. if you do the latter, this sentence will have context.}{8}{section*.37}

\contentsline {todo}{before yesterday}{14}{section*.82}
\contentsline {todo}{within the first day? need to be more specific here. cases observed are very late. even best case scenario might be outside of window when most maternal and neonatal deaths occur.}{17}{section*.89}
