\contentsline {todo}{This section isn't finished yet. Will be adding more detail on HCD methodology and how it specifically relates to the project.

\contentsline {todo}{add that most deaths occur during delivery or within first few days}{13}{section*.37}

\contentsline {todo}{i'd make this last sentence a new paragraph and describe the kenyan system in a few sentences. alternatively, and maybe preferably, add this to the introduction. if you do the latter, this sentence will have context.}{15}{section*.58}
