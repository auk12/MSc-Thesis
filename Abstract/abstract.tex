Most maternal deaths are avoidable. Delays in recognizing the need to seek care, delays in accessing  health care facilities, and delays in receiving adequate care can all make delivery of effective maternal health care practices very difficult. In recent years, mobile phones have grown in popularity for improving disease prevention and management, especially in the field of maternal and child health. The intent of this study was to design and pilot a mobile-phone based patient management system intended for use by community health volunteers, who serve as the primary providers of maternal and child health care in Kenya. Using a human-centered design framework, a prototype was developed to fit into the CHVs' existing workflows in order to improve delivery of care at the community level. Integrating both voice and text-based interfaces, the system was found to be highly usable based on self-report data.
