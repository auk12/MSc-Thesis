Using the web-based Verboice platform, the research team built upon the existing Baby Monitor platform to create call flows designed for use by CHVs at Sinoko. Each call flow consisted of a series of instructions, questions, and prompts that require numeric input from the user's phone keypad, and was designed to address the design principles and themes identified for the patient management system during the first phase of the design process. For questions that required a 'yes' or 'no' answer, users were asked to press '1' or '3' on their keypads. For other questions, users were also asked to enter numerical data through their keypads. No data or answers to questions were stored locally on their phones; all responses to all questions were saved to the research team's Verboice database.}{11}{section*.60}}

On the first field visit day with the research team, the CHV visited two new mothers after hearing from another community member that they had given birth within the past two months. Although the CHVs acknowledged a potential time delay in identifying deliveries by word of mouth, they collectively agreed that most deliveries were reported relatively soon after taking place.}{17}{section*.89}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The clinic nurses indicated that the only report of home deliveries they receive are on the CHV monthly reports, which they previously acknowledged to using very rarely. They attributed the preference to deliver at home to cost of travel to Sinoko, and also indicated that not regularly checking for the number of recent deliveries presents challenges for providing postnatal care to women and children who may need it at the clinic.}{17}{section*.90}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{To address these findings, the research team designed a call flow similar to that of reporting CHV home visits for reporting deliveries. After flashing the Baby Monitor system and identifying themselves as CHVs, the CHV is asked to identify the woman who has delivered by her phone number. Date of delivery is indicated by pressing '1' for the current day, '2' for the previous day, and '3' for another date, which is input directly using their keypads. This delivery information is saved into the Baby Monitor database, and the call is completed.}{17}{section*.91}}

This information is saved into the Baby Monitor database, and the call is completed. For deliveries at the clinic, all successful deliveries by enrolled women were logged by the clinic nurses. This logged data was entered via FormHub and stored in the Baby Monitor database. Using both sources of information, the clinic visit notification system was adapted to instead provide delivery notifications. In a similar manner, text messages were sent to CHVs every morning, informing them of deliveries that took place on the previous day.}{19}{section*.94}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The CHV focus group identified emergency reporting as a major area of concern in their existing workflow. CHVs reported that they were usually called by a family member during a health-related or pregnancy-related emergency. In most cases, they recommended that the patient travel to Sinoko\todo {i'd refrain from using the clinic name throughout this document, even in the setup section} to receive care at the clinic. However, they noted numerous occasions in which the patient arrived at Sinoko, only to find the clinic understaffed at that time of day or unprepared to handle certain emergency procedures due to limited medical supplies. The group attributed this to a lack of direct communication between the CHVs and the clinic, indicating if they knew that the clinic was not prepared for an incoming patient, they could refer and accompany the patient to another clinic or Webuye District Hospial\todo {same here. refer to closest level 3 facility}. They also indicated that news of these missed emergencies contributed to an unwillingness to visit Sinoko among community members. This perception was reflected during both field visit dates, as three separate pregnant women expressed some concern about delivering at Sinoko due to a combination of cost and prior missed emergencies.}{19}{section*.98}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Discussion with the clinic nurses also reflected concerns about emergency reporting and referral to the clinic. The nurses acknowledged that there was little to no direct communication between CHVs and the clinic staff about incoming emergencies. Pregnant women often came to deliver with little prior notice at any time of the day, making it difficult for the nurses to prepare for their care. The nurses indicated that only one nurse is typically on call overnight, and at least two nurses are needed to complete a safe delivery procedure. Moreover, the nurses indicated that the clinic has capacity for only three deliveries per week due to limited supplies. If more than three women came into the clinic for a delivery, they would have to wait for an ambulance to arrive from Webuye to take them to the District Hospital in town.}{20}{section*.99}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Based on these results, the research team designed a simple call flow to be used by patients, family members of patients, and CHVs to report an emergency to a nurse on staff at Sinoko clinic. The user flashes the Baby Monitor system, and indicates that they would like to report an emergency. After confirming that the user would like to speak directly to a clinic nurse, the system forwards the call to the clinic phone, free of charge to the user. The user can then describe the emergency to the nurse at the clinic, and the nurse can advise the patient, family member, or CHV on how to proceed. This allows the nurse to prepare for the arrival of the patient and call the other nurses to the clinic if necessary.}{20}{section*.100}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Mock testing of the above features was focused on identifying key strengths and areas for improvement for the system. Participants of the focus group indicated that the system was straightforward and simple, and was designed to provide useful information for their daily responsibilities. Participants also noted that the text message notifications regarding completed referrals and deliveries at the clinic would be helpful in terms of data collection for their biweekly reports. In all, the CHVs agreed that the major design features of the system addressed their major areas of concern in regards to communication between CHVs, the clinic, and their patients.}{20}{section*.101}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{While the participants were optimistic about the potential of the prototypes demonstrated at the mock testing session, they also voiced concern about accessing the system via mobile phone. Participants indicated that a lack of credit on CHV phones would affect use of the system, as a minimal amount of credit is required for a user to flash a number. According to the group, most CHVs carried very little credit on their phones on a day-to-day basis, adding money only when necessary due to cost. Group participants suggested that use of the system would vary greatly, since some CHVs were better at maintaining credit and using their phones regularly than others. To address these findings, the research team opted to provide a 50 Ksh incentive for each home visit and delivery reported by participating CHVs, thus encouraging CHVs to maintain a minimal amount of credit in order to engage with the system.}{22}{section*.102}}
